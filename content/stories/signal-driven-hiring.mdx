## Problem
Teams were making high-stakes hiring decisions with inconsistent criteria and noisy feedback.

## Constraints
Different orgs had different interview styles, tools, and role definitions.

## Approach
I introduced role-specific competencies, normalized interview evidence, and enforced structured debrief narratives.

## Results
Decision velocity increased and false-positive hiring decreased.

## Lessons
Clear decision rubrics improve both fairness and speed.
