## Problem
Legacy systems slowed recruiters and made candidate signals hard to trust.

## Constraints
Business continuity requirements ruled out downtime or phased team pauses.

## Approach
I split the migration by workflow boundaries, introduced typed contracts, and shipped incremental slices behind feature flags.

## Results
Recruiter throughput increased while reliability and reporting quality improved.

## Lessons
Architecture only sticks when paired with simple operating rules and visible evidence.
