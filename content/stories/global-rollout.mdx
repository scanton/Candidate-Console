## Problem
Regional teams operated with different standards, creating candidate inconsistency.

## Constraints
The framework had to preserve local legal and cultural requirements.

## Approach
I built a core operating model and layered regional playbooks plus facilitator training.

## Results
Teams moved faster with fewer escalations and stronger candidate experience consistency.

## Lessons
Global systems need local adaptation points by design.
